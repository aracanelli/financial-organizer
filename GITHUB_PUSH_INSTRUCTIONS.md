# GitHub Push Instructions

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Open your web browser and go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
4. Configure your repository:
   - Repository name: `financial-organizer`
   - Description: "A comprehensive application to manage personal finances, track expenses, and organize receipts."
   - Visibility: Choose Public or Private
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (as we already have these files)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Copy the repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.

Look for the repository URL in the "Quick setup" section at the top. It will look like one of these:
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/financial-organizer.git`
- SSH: `git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/financial-organizer.git`

Copy the HTTPS URL (unless you have SSH keys set up, then use the SSH URL).

## 3. Connect and push your repository

Run the following commands in your terminal, replacing `YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL` with the URL you copied:

```powershell
# Add the remote repository connection
git remote add origin YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## 4. Authentication

When pushing, you might be prompted for authentication:

- If you're using HTTPS: Enter your GitHub username and personal access token (not your password)
- If you're using SSH: Make sure your SSH key is set up on GitHub

## 5. Verify the push

After pushing:
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files listed in the repository

Congratulations! Your Financial Organizer is now on GitHub!
