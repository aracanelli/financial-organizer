/**
 * This is a manual test file for the Login component.
 * Since we're having issues with Jest configuration and ES modules,
 * this provides steps to manually verify the login redirect functionality.
 * 
 * Manual Test Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Open the browser developer console (F12)
 * 2. Navigate to the login page (/login)
 * 3. Enter valid credentials (e.g., test@example.com / password123)
 * 4. Click the "Sign In" button
 * 5. Observe console logs:
 *    - Should see "Attempting login with: {email: 'test@example.com'}"
 *    - If successful, should see "Login response received: 200"
 *    - Should see "Login successful, currentUser set: true"
 *    - Should see "Login successful, navigating to home page"
 * 6. Verify that the application redirects to the home page (/)
 * 
 * If the redirection isn't working:
 * - Check the console for any error messages
 * - Verify that the `navigate('/')` call in Login.js is being executed
 * - Check for any issues with routing configuration in App.js
